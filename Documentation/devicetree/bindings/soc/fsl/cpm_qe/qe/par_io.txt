* Parallel I/O Ports

This node configures Parallel I/O ports for CPUs with QE support.
The node should reside in the "soc" node of the tree.  For each
device that using parallel I/O ports, a child node should be created.
See the definition of the Pin configuration nodes below for more
information.

Required properties:
- device_type : should be "par_io".
- reg : offset to the register set and its length.
- num-ports : number of Parallel I/O ports

Example:
par_io@1400 {
	reg = <1400 100>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	device_type = "par_io";
	num-ports = <7>;
	ucc_pin@1 {
		......
	};

Note that "par_io" nodes are obsolete, and should not be used for
the new device trees. Instead, each Par I/O bank should be represented
via its own gpio-controller node.
